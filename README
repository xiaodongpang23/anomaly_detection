# Challenge Summary

Imagine you're at an e-commerce company, Market-ter, that also has a social network. In addition to shopping, users can see which items their friends are buying, and are influenced by the purchases within their network. 

Your challenge is to build a real-time platform to analyze purchases within a social network of users, and detect any behavior that is far from the average within that social network.

### Example

A Product Manager at Market-ter approaches you with a new idea to encourage users to spend more money, without serving them pesky ads for items. The Product Manager shows you the following diagram and says: 

<img src="./images/social-network.png" width="150">

"If User A makes a large purchase, we should flag them to make sure User B and User C are influenced by it. We could highlight these large purchases in their "feed". We could also send an email to User D, recommending that they become friends with User A. They won't find these emails annoying because they share the mutual friend, User C.

But we can't send our users too many emails, so we should only do this with really high purchases that are considered "anomalies" - those that are 3 standard deviations above the average within their social network. These emails will ensure that our top spenders are the most connected and influential!"

Despite the excitement, you realize the Product Manager hasn't fully thought out two specific aspects of the problem:

1. Social networks change their purchasing behavior over time, so we shouldn't average over the full history of transactions. **How many transactions should we include in the average?**

2. Users only accept "nearby" recommendations. Recommendations might work for a "friend of a friend" (`Degree = 2`), but would a "friend of a friend of a friend" (`Degree = 3`) still work? **How many "degrees" should a social network include?**

Since the Product Manager doesn't know these factors yet, your platform must be flexible enough to easily adjust these parameters. Also, it will take in a lot of data, so it has to efficiently scale with the size of the input.

# Details of Implementation
With this coding challenge, you should demonstrate a strong understanding of computer science fundamentals. We won't be wowed by your knowledge of various available software libraries but will be impressed by your ability to pick and use the best data structures and algorithms for the job.

We're looking for clean, well-thought-out code that correctly implements the desired feature in an optimized way and highlights your ability to write production-quality code and clear documentation.

## Parameters

For this challenge, you'll need two flexible parameters 

`D`: the number of degrees that defines a user's social network.

`T`: the number of consecutive purchases made by a user's social network (not including the user's own purchases)

A purchase amount is anomalous if it's more than 3 standard deviations from the mean of the last `T` purchases in the user's `D`th degree social network. As an expression, an anomalous amount is anything greater than `mean + (3 * sd)` where `sd` stands for standard deviation (see the FAQ for the mean and standard deviation). 

### Number of degrees in social network (`D`)
 
`D` should not be hardcoded, and will be at least `1`.

A value of `1` means you should only consider the friends of the user. A value of `2` means the social network extends to friends and "friends of friends".

For example, if `D = 1`, User A's social network would only consist of User B and User C but not User D.

If `D = 2`, User A's social network would consist of User B, User C, and User D.

### Tracked number of purchases in the user's network (`T`)

`T` also shouldn't be hardcoded, and will be at least `2`.

The latest purchase is the one with the highest timestamp. If 2 purchases have the same timestamp, the one listed first would be considered the earlier one.

If a user's social network has less than 2 purchases, we don't have enough historical information, so no purchases should be considered anomalous at that point. 

If a user's social network has made 2 or more purchases, but less than `T`, we should still proceed with the calucations to determine if the purchases are anomalous.


### Input Data
Ideally, the input data would come from a real-time, streaming API, but we don't want this challenge to focus on the relatively uninteresting task of connecting to an API.

As a result, you may assume that the purchases and social network events have already been collected in two logs (in the log_input directory), which we can replay to mimic the data stream.

The first file, `batch_log.json`, contains past data that should be used to build the initial state of the entire user network, as well as the purchase history of the users.

Data in the second file, `stream_log.json`, should be used to determine whether a purchase is anomalous. If a purchase is flagged as anomalous, it should be logged in the `flagged_purchases.json` file. As events come in, both the social network and the purchase history of users should get updated.

The first line of `batch_log.json` contains a JSON object with the parameters:  degree (`D`) and number of tracked purchases (`T`) to consider for the calculation.

The rest of the events in both `batch_log.json` and `stream_log.json` fall into the following 3 categories:

 * `purchase` - includes a `timestamp`, user `id` and the `amount` paid. 
 * `befriend` - two users becoming friends (all friendships are considered bi-directional)
 * `unfriend` - two users ending their friendship
 
For example, the top of `batch_log.json` could be:

    {"D":"3", "T":"50"}
    {"event_type":"purchase", "timestamp":"2017-06-13 11:33:01", "id": "1", "amount": "16.83"}
    {"event_type":"purchase", "timestamp":"2017-06-13 11:33:01", "id": "1", "amount": "59.28"}
    {"event_type":"befriend", "timestamp":"2017-06-13 11:33:01", "id1": "1", "id2": "2"}
    {"event_type":"befriend", "timestamp":"2017-06-13 11:33:01", "id1": "3", "id2": "1"}
    {"event_type":"purchase", "timestamp":"2017-06-13 11:33:01", "id": "1", "amount": "11.20"}
    {"event_type":"unfriend", "timestamp":"2017-06-13 11:33:01", "id1": "1", "id2": "3"}

While an event in `stream_log.json` could be:

    {"event_type":"purchase", "timestamp":"2017-06-13 11:33:02", "id": "2", "amount": "1601.83"}

### Output Data
Write all the flagged purchases to a file, named `flagged_purchases.json`, with the extra fields of `mean` and `sd` (the order of both the events and the json fields should remain the same as in `stream_log.json`). Please report the values of `mean` and `sd` truncated to two decimal points (e.g. `3.46732` -> `3.46`). If there is no flagged event `flagged_purchases.json` should be empty, but present.

Flagged events are still valid, and can contribute to the baseline for the social network.

An example output in `flagged_purchases.json` could be:

    {"event_type":"purchase", "timestamp":"2017-06-13 11:33:02", "id": "2", "amount": "1601.83", "mean": "29.10", "sd": "21.46"}

### Sample Data
You can find a medium sized sample data set in the `sample_dataset` folder.
